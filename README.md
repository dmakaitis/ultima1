# Ultima I
This is aroject to reverse engineer Ultima I for the Commodore 64, mostly as an exercise to finally get around to learning machine language programming on the Commodore 64.

The initial goal will be to create the source code necessary to create a D64 image to contains a byte for byte duplicate of Ultima I. The source code will be annotated with my comments as I try to figure out how it works.

Since I am unclear on the current copyright status of Ultima I, this project will never contain any of the game data, such as maps, art assets, etc., so as those parts are added, this project will require a copy of the original C64 version of Ultima I to build. Of course, that would also open the possibility to customize those assets, which might allow a new game to be built using the Ultima I engine at some point in the future.
