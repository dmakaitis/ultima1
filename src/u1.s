; This program simply blanks the screen, then loads the "hello" file into memory
; at $8000 and passing it control.
;
; This program is positioned so that when it is loaded into memory at $02d7,
; the BASIC idle loop vector is overwritten with the value $02d7. The result is
; that the program will immediately execute when loaded by typing:
;
;     LOAD "u1",8,1
;
; (or LOAD "*",8,1, assuming it is the first file on disk)

; into the correct location. For this to work, the linker will need to be
; configured so that the starting address is $02d7 (see u1.cfg).
