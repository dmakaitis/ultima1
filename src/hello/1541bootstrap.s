;                       read_256_bytes
;
; Reads 256 bytes of data over the serial CLOCK and DATA
; lines. Instead of reading the data normally, four samples
; of both lines will be taken for each byte of data. Each
; sample will read the following bits of data:
;
;     SAMPLE  CLOCK    DATA
;       1       7       5
;       2       6       4
;       3       3       1
;       4       2       0
;
; Note this is different than how the C64 receives data as
; the data is encoded on each end in a manner that can be
; decoded on the other end the fastest based on available
; hardware.
;
; To ensure proper timing, interupts must be disabled prior
; to calling this routine.
